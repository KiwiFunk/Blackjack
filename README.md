# Blackjack

My first project in C#! A simple console version of Blackjack! Finish the game with a higher total than that of the dealer, without exceeding 21. 

This allows for multiple players and features a basic betting system.

# Features
<ul>
    <li>Play on your own, or with multiple (local) players!</li>
    <li>Place wagers!</li>
    <li>Features a proper deck of cards, not just randomly generated values from 1-10</li>
    <li>Has logic for Ace being played as a 1, or an 11.</li>
<ul>


# To-Do
<ul>
    <li>Add loops to allow for starting a new round with current players and bank balance or a new game state</li>
    <li>Add Split, Double Down, Insurance and Surrender options in addition to Hit and Stand</li>
</ul>
